# Hi, I'm Eugene Bulgakov 👋
### Senior Frontend Fullstack Engineer (React, TypeScript, Vue, Next, Express, NodeJS, MongoDB) | High-Load E-commerce | Performance Optimization & Developer Experience Focused

I specialize in building **high-load frontend systems** and designing architectures for scalable web applications.

With over **10 years of industry experience**, I have evolved from implementing pixel-perfect designs to managing the frontend of an e-commerce platform with **100,000+ daily users**.

My engineering philosophy rests on three pillars: **Performance**, **Maintainability**, and **Developer Experience**. I believe that clean code is not just aesthetics, but a business asset.

## 🚀 Current Focus & Impact

My last employment **JiffyShirts.com**, where I own critical performance metrics and codebase quality.

* **Optimization:** Doubled key metrics in **PageSpeed Insights** by completely overhauling the build infrastructure (Webpack) and optimizing dependencies.
* **Scale:** Maintaining and evolving a platform serving millions of requests.
* **Quality:** Establishing Code Review and CI/CD processes for a team of 70+ engineers, implementing strict linting and testing standards (Jest, ESLint).

* **[dns-markdown-api](https://github.com/ebulgakov/dns-markdown-api)** - API for the service
